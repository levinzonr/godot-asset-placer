## Installation
1. There are several ways to install the addon: 
- [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/4244) or by searching for "Godot Asset Placer"
- [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/levinzonr/godot-asset-placer/releases) and download the latest release
- Manually by cloning the repository
No matter which method you choose, the remaining steps are the same

2. Copy the `addons/asset_placer` folder into your Godot project under the `addons` directory. (Godot Asset Library will do this automatically)
3. Enable the plugin in the Godot Editor by going to `Project` -> `Project Settings` -> `Plugins` and enabling the `Asset Placer` plugin.

## Usage
### Adding Assets
Right now the plugin relies on user selecting the folders where your assets are located so that not every scene is added automatically.
You can folders to sync by either Drag And Droping the folder or  using "Add folder button" within Folders Tab

### Placing Assets
Godot Asset Placer is using RayCasting to determine where to place the asset. This means that you can place assets on any surface that has a CollisionShape attached to it.
To place an asset, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the 3D Scene of your choice
2. Open Asset Placer Dock window and select the asset you want to place from the Assets tab
3. Optional: Change Parent Node. By default, the Plugin will select as Root Node3D as the parent, you can change it withing Options Sub View
4. At this point you will see a preview of the asset in the 3D viewport
5. Press `Left Mouse Button` to place the asset at the location of the mouse cursor
6. If you want to modify the asset after placement, you can press `Shift` + `Left Mouse Button` to Place And Focus on the Placed Asset. This allows you to move, rotate, or scale the asset using the standard Godot Editor tools.

### Organizing Assets
You can organize your assets into Collections. Collections is a simple way to "group" assets together by some criteria. For example, you can create a collection for all the trees in your scene, or all the rocks, etc.
To create a collection navigate to the Collections tab, choose a name and color. Then you can assing assets into one or more collections, either by using a options menu or draggin and dropping assets into the window while Collection Filter is activee

## Known Issues
- So far plugin only supports .tscn files, glb and fbx models. If you have any other formats you would like to see supported, please let me know.
- Sometimes Previews for the Assets are not perfect - but they are directly take from the Godot Previews system
- The UI is work in progress..
