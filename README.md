## Installation
1. There are several ways to install the addon: 
- [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/4244) or by searching for "Godot Asset Placer"
- [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/levinzonr/godot-asset-placer/releases) and download the latest release
- Manually by cloning the repository
No matter which method you choose, the remaining steps are the same

2. Copy the `addons/asset_placer` folder into your Godot project under the `addons` directory. (Godot Asset Library will do this automatically)
3. Enable the plugin in the Godot Editor by going to `Project` -> `Project Settings` -> `Plugins` and enabling the `Asset Placer` plugin.

## Usage
### Adding Assets
Right now the plugin relies on user selecting the folders where your assets are located so that not every scene is added automatically.
You can folders to sync by either Drag And Droping the folder or  using "Add folder button" within Folders Tab
![addon_folders.png](docs/addon_folders.png)


### Placing Assets
Godot Asset Placer provides various placement modes. All methods rely on RayCasting to determine where to place the asset.

Placement Modes can be cycled using `Q` Shortcut

#### Surface Collisions (Default)
This mode requires your scene to have Collision Objects (StaticBody3D, CollisionShape3D, etc.) in order to place assets on surfaces. This mode is useful when your scene already has some kind of physical floor and you want your assets placed directly onto it.

#### Plane Collisions
This mode allows you to place assets on an infinite plane at a specified height. This is useful for quickly placing assets in an empty scene or when you want to place assets at a specific height without relying on existing geometry. This plane has a configurable Normal and Point Of origin.
You can quickly enter this mode by pressing `Q` while in placement mode.

If you want to configure Plane Options (Normal and Origin) you can do so within Options Sub View or with `W` Translate Mode
This will allow to move the plane origin using Mouse Wheel along selected Axis

#### Terrain 3d Placement
This mode allows you to place assets directly onto a Terrain3D surface. When selected you will be prompted to select your Terrain3D node. After that the plugin will user Terrain3D surfaces to resolve placement location.

#### Placement Steps
To place an asset, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the 3D Scene of your choice
2. Optional: Change Placement Mode. By default, the Plugin uses Surface Collision mode, you can change it within Options Sub View
3. Open Asset Placer Dock window and select the asset you want to place from the Assets tab
4. Optional: Change Parent Node. By default, the Plugin will select as Root Node3D as the parent, you can change it withing Options Sub View
5. Optional: Configure Placement Options:
   - **Align Normals** - Enable to align assets with surface normals for natural placement on sloped surfaces
   - **Use Assets Origin** - Enable to place using asset's local origin point, or disable to use the asset's actual bottom
6. At this point you will see a preview of the asset in the 3D viewport
7. Press `Left Mouse Button` to place the asset at the location of the mouse cursor
8. If you want to modify the asset after placement, you can press `Shift` + `Left Mouse Button` to Place And Focus on the Placed Asset. This allows you to move, rotate, or scale the asset using the standard Godot Editor tools.

#### Random Asset Placement
You can enable random asset placement in the Asset Placement Options. When enabled, after each placement, a new asset will be randomly selected from the currently filtered list of assets in the Assets Panel. This is useful for quickly populating scenes with varied assets.

> ⚠️ This feature is experimental and may require further improvements in the future.

#### Transforming Assets Before Placement
1.1.0 introduces the ability to modify the preview of the asset before placement. This includes options for rotation and scaling, allowing users to visualize how the asset will appear in the scene prior to placement, do quick and precise adjustment modifications.
![addon_viewport_controls.png](docs/addon_viewport_controls.png)
Specific transformation mode can be enabled by pressing button while in placement mode (Asset is selected) and transformations can be applied by Mouse Wheel:
- `Mouse Wheel Up`: "Positive" transformation
- `Mouse Wheel Down`: "Negative" transformation

Following transformations are supported:
- `E` to rotate (Default axis is Y)
- `R` to scale (Uniform Scale by default, All axis at once)
- `W` to translate (Default axis is Y) - Activates `Plane Placement Mode`

This also requires an ability to select active Axis for the transformation. This can be done by pressing following keys:
- `X` to select X axis
- `Y` to select Y axis
- `Z` to select Z axis

#### In Place Transform Mode
1.2.0 introduces **In Place Transform Mode**, which allows you to apply transformations to existing nodes in your scene using the same Asset Placer transformation workflow. This is useful when you want to adjust nodes that are already placed in your scene.

To use In Place Transform Mode:
1. Select a Node3D in the scene tree
2. Press `Shift+E` (default shortcut, configurable in Settings) to enter In Place Transform Mode
3. Use the same transformation shortcuts (`E` for rotate, `R` for scale, `W` for translate) to modify the selected node
4. Use `X`, `Y`, `Z` keys to select the transformation axis
5. Apply transformations with Mouse Wheel Up/Down

The viewport overlay will display the current transformation mode and active axis, just like in preview placement mode.

### Organizing Assets
You can organize your assets into Collections. Collections is a simple way to "group" assets together by some criteria. For example, you can create a collection for all the trees in your scene, or all the rocks, etc.
To create a collection navigate to the Collections tab, choose a name and color. Then you can assing assets into one or more collections, either by using a options menu or draggin and dropping assets into the window while Collection Filter is activee


### Settings Panel
Version 1.2.0 introduced a dedicated Settings Panel for comprehensive customization of the Asset Placer plugin. Access it through `Project` -> `Project Settings` -> `Plugins` -> `Asset Placer` -> `Settings Panel`.

#### General Settings
- **Preview Material** - Choose your own Material3D resource or disable preview materials entirely
- **Plane Material** - Customize the appearance of the plane used in Plane Placement Mode (Project-level setting)
- **Transform Step** - Configure the amount of rotation/scale applied per Mouse Wheel step
  - Rotation Step (default: 5 degrees)
  - Scale/Translate Step (default: 0.1 units)
- **Thumbnail UI Scale** - Adjust the size of thumbnails in the Assets Panel (default: 1.0)
- **Plane Mode Toggle** - Configure plane placement mode behavior
- **Asset Library Path** - Set a custom location for the `asset_library.json` file, useful for version control and team sharing

#### Key Bindings
Customize shortcuts for all Asset Placer actions:
- Rotate (Default: `E`)
- Scale (Default: `R`)
- Translate (Default: `W`)
- Cycle Placement Modes (Default: `Q`)
- Toggle Snapping (Default: `S`)
- Toggle X, Y, Z Axis (Default: `X`, `Y`, `Z`)
- Transform Apply (Default: Mouse Wheel Up/Down)
- In Place Transform Mode (Default: `Shift+E`)

Key bindings support Mouse Button and Modifier Combinations (Ctrl, Shift, Alt), allowing you to avoid conflicts with existing Godot shortcuts. The Settings Panel includes conflict detection that will highlight conflicting keys in red.

All settings are persisted across Godot sessions within EditorSettings and apply to all your projects.

## Known Issues
- So far plugin only supports `tscn` files, `glb`, `gltf` `obj` and `fbx` models. If you have any other formats you would like to see supported, please let me know.
- Sometimes Previews for the Assets are not perfect - but they are directly take from the Godot Previews system
