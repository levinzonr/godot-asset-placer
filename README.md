## Placing Assets
To place an asset, select it from the list and click and navigate to the 3D scene of you choice. If all goes well, you should see a preview of your asset snapping to the neares surface
Click again to place the asset in the scene.

## Organizing Assets
You can organize your assets into collections by selecting the assets and clicking the "Create Collection" button. This will create a new collection with the selected assets. You can also filter assets by their name and collection using the search bar at the top of the plugin window.

Collections is a simple way to "group" assets together by some criteria. For example, you can create a collection for all the trees in your scene, or all the rocks, etc.

## Known Issues
- So far plugin only supports .tscn files, glb and fbx models. If you have any other formats you would like to see supported, please let me know.
- The UI is work in progress..
