# Godot Asset Placer Changelog

## 1.1.0-alpha4
### Fixed
- Fixed an Issue where Snapping would not work when placing assets (#26)

## 1.1.0-alpha3

## Added
- Q Shortcut to cycle through Placement Modes
- W (Translate shortcut) preview transform now toggles `Plane Placement Mode`. This provides a way to continiously place assets on a plane with configurable point of origin
- Empty View for the Collections Picker that can navigate to the collections tab

## Fixed
- Fixed an Issue where Scale Preview transform would get reset after moving an asset
- #11 Plugins Dock now has a minimum height to avoid UI issues when collapsing it too much

## 1.1.0-alpha2
Alpha2 introduces a new Placement feature: Placement Modes and some bug fixes.

### Normal Alignment - Slopes and Vertical Surfaces
When placing assets on sloped or vertical surfaces, the asset will now align with the surface normal, providing a more natural placement.

### Placement Modes
1.1.0-alpha2 introduces the ability to choose between different placement modes

#### Surface Collision
This is  default placement mode and it is almost indentical to the approach used in previous version. This mode requires your scene to have a Collision Objects present in your scene. The RayCast will then try and hit any collision objects creating a placement point for your collision.


#### Plane Collisions (New)
This mode does not require any collision objects to be present in your scene. Instead it uses a virtual plane that has a configurable point of origin and normal direction. The RayCast will then try and hit this virtual plane creating a placement point for your collision.

> Plane Options Configuration (Normals and Origin) are not perfect as it kind of takes away from the placement flow - Right now, you need to manually change Vector3 in UI. If anyone has a idea about how to improve this please let me know.

### Added
- Added GLTF Assets Support #15

### Fixed
- Added more sanity checks for thumbnail generation
- Preview Transforms: Flipped Negative and Positive transformation directions to be more intuitive
- Add Minimum Height for the Asset Placer Dock Panel #16

## 1.1.0-alpha1
First major Alpha release after the stable 1.0.0 version ðŸš€.

This release introduces a new feature that allows users to transform the preview of the asset before placement, including rotation and scaling options, as well as support for `obj` files and some bug fixes.
### Preview Transformation
1.1.0 introduces the ability to modify the preview of the asset before placement. This includes options for rotation and scaling, allowing users to visualize how the asset will appear in the scene prior to placement, do quick and precise adjustment modifications.

Specific transformation mode can be enabled by pressing button while in placement mode (Asset is selected) and transformations can be applied by Mouse Wheel:
- `Mouse Wheel Up`: "Positive" transformation
- `Mouse Wheel Down`: "Negative" transformation

Following transformations are supported:
- `E` to rotate (Default axis is Y)
- `R` to scale (Uniform Scale by default, All axis at once)
- `W` to translate (Default axis is Z)

This also requires an ability to select active Axis for the transformation. This can be done by pressing following keys:
- `X` to select X axis
- `Y` to select Y axis
- `Z` to select Z axis

#### UI Updates
To support this feature a 3D View Port Overlay has been added to show the current transformation mode and active axis
